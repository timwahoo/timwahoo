- 👋 Hi, I’m @timwahoo. 
- 👀 I’m interested in MRI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linear Algebra
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source imaging
This github serves as my sandbox for anything and everything that I find interesting for my applications of MRI. It's a curation of forks that range from the basics to advance MRI topics.
